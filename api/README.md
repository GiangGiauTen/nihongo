# Kotobaweb API

This is the backend API for Kotobaweb.com. It has a REST API to handle user login and auth (via Discord OAuth2), getting quiz session reports, and getting/creating custom quiz decks. It also has a websocket API for the web versions of the quiz and shiritori features (that will be split into a separate project eventually).

## Configuration and running

Follow the directions in the [top level readme](https://github.com/mistval/kotoba).
